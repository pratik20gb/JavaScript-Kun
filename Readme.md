# JavaScript Learning Repository

Welcome to my JavaScript Learning Repository! This repository captures my journey through learning JavaScript as I tackle various programming challenges and practice implementing different JavaScript features and patterns.

## About

This repository serves as a record of my learning progress in JavaScript. Here, Iâ€™ll be adding solutions to problems, along with explanations and notes. Each section covers essential JavaScript concepts that will strengthen the foundational knowledge required for web development.

## Repository Structure

JavaScript Basics: A collection of code snippets and examples covering the basics of JavaScript, such as syntax, data types, and control flow.
Advanced JavaScript: Solutions and explanations for more advanced JavaScript concepts, including closures, asynchronous programming, and the DOM.
Algorithms and Data Structures in JavaScript: Implementations of algorithms and data structures using JavaScript.

## Topics Covered

The repository is divided into the following sections:

### JavaScript Basics:

- Variables and Data Types
- Functions (Regular, Arrow Functions)
- Control Flow (if-else, switch, loops)
- Scope and Hoisting
- Events and the DOM
- Error Handling

### Advanced JavaScript:

- Closures and Lexical Scoping
- Prototypes and Inheritance
- Asynchronous JavaScript (Promises, async/await)
- Modules and Imports/Exports
- ES6+ Features

### Algorithms and Data Structures in JavaScript:

- Arrays and Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees)
- Sorting (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort)
- Searching (Linear Search, Binary Search)
- Recursion and Backtracking

## #365DaysOfCode

This repository is also a part of my #365DaysOfCode journey, where I aim to code and learn JavaScript every day. Each day, I will add new content, code snippets, or problem solutions to continue expanding my knowledge.

Feel free to explore, clone, and use any part of this repository for your own learning journey!
